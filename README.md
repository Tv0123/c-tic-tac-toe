# c++ tic tac toe
A simple tic tac toe game made in c++. Feel free to skid for what ever purposes you want. Pls give credits even though this is not the best :)

To play simply enter the value of where you want to draw your mark

I.e the top left corner is a1, bottom right is c3. Note you have to keep these in lower case (too lazy to add check)
